I'm a Frontend Web-Developer who loves to solve problems and build amazing things!

```python
class SoftwareDeveloper:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Aaron"
        self.role = "Frontend Web-Developer"
        self.language_spoken = ["en_US", "de_DE"]

    def say_hi(self):
        print("Thanks for dropping by, hope you find some of my work interesting.")

me = SoftwareDeveloper()
me.say_hi()
```
