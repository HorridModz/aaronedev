Im a **Web Developer** who loves to bring ideas to life in the browser. I grew up in the 90's early 2000's and fell in love with the internet. Therefore I am excited about designing and developing websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. Also, I kind of want to bring back the 90's web design aesthetic. I think it was cool. 😎

## 📈 My GitHub stats

## 📚 I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation. I do though. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. Its like a story telling what the code can do and how it does it. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

## 🖥️ Windows Lover

I grew up with Windows and have a special place in my heart for it. Its my go-to operating system for development.

## 🐧 Linux Enthusiast

I love working with Linux and Im always exploring new things in the vast open-source world.

## 💻 Version Control

I use Git for version control - its simple, powerful, and widely used.
