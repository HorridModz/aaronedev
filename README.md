<div class="github-introduction">

I'm a **Web Developer** who loves bringing ideas to life in the browser. I grew up in the '90s and early 2000s and fell in love with the internet. I‚Äôm passionate about designing and developing websites and web applications that are **fast**, **responsive**, and **accessible** to everyone. Also, I kind of want to bring back the '90s web design aesthetic. I think it was cool. üòé

## üåü Featured Projects

- **[Violet Void Theme](https://violet-void-theme.com)**: Violet Void Theme is a set of configuration files designed to give Windows an amazing visual overhaul with a sleek, violet-toned aesthetic. This theme applies consistent violet tones throughout the interface, providing a unique and cohesive look that enhances the user experience. In addition to the visual enhancements, I‚Äôve also integrated several Linux-like functionalities into Windows, making the operating system more powerful and customizable for advanced users. Furthermore, I am working on custom glyphs to enhance the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) experience, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **[PowerShell Profile Configuration](#)**: I am working on a comprehensive PowerShell profile that integrates all my custom configurations into a powerful and cohesive setup. This profile is designed to streamline workflows and enhance productivity by leveraging the full potential of PowerShell, combined with my Violet Void Theme. Additionally, I am developing this profile to be fully featured and driven by Linux-like commands, bringing the familiarity and efficiency of Linux command-line tools to the Windows environment. Once finalized, I plan to publish this profile so that others can benefit from a fully optimized and visually appealing PowerShell environment.

## üìÉ I love documentation

Not many developers like to write documentation, but I do. I believe that a well-documented codebase is as important as the code itself. It‚Äôs like a story, telling what the code can do and how it works. I always try to write clear, concise, and useful documentation. My go-to documentation tool is <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian.md</a>.

Whenever I write documentation, I try to keep the following steps in mind to ensure the reader gets the most out of it:

1. **What** is this documentation about?
2. **Why** is this documentation important?
3. **How** can the reader use this documentation?
4. **When** should the reader use this documentation?
5. **Who** is this documentation for?

### <p align="center">‚öôÔ∏è My development environment </p>

> I grew up with Windows and it holds a special place in my heart. It‚Äôs my go-to operating system for development, where I make extensive use of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and the Windows Terminal. I also use PowerShell, which I‚Äôve customized with my own configurations built from and modules scratch, to create a highly efficient and personalized terminal environment.
